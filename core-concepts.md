# Functional Programming: Concepts
<br>
<br>


## Functional Programming is based on Lambda Calculus 


1) In lambda calculus, all functions can be written anonymously without a name.
    
    Why? Because the only portion of a function header that affects its execution is the list of arguments.

2) When invoked, all functions will go through a process called **currying**
